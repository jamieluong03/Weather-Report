# Weather-Report

In this Weather Dashboard, the user is able to enter a City name in the search bar and click search.

Once the search is initiated, it will call the city's weather data from Open Weather and appear in the screens on the right.

The top screen will show the weather report for the current date, which includes information such as temperature, humidity, and windspeed.

The bottom screen will show the weather report for the following five days with the same information.

Every time the user enters a new City into the search bar, the history is saved as a list on the left column.
